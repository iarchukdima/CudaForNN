In this project numpy(on cuda), C code on CUDA and on CPU are compared in the task of classification for MNIST dataset. MLP architecture is used as it is a building block for other types of neural networks.

For the matMul and Softmax naive and more advanced kernels were implemented and compared in speedup.
